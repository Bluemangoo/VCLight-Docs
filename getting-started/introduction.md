## What is VCLight?

VClight is a framwork for Vercel Serverless Function. It can help you process all pages in one function, to build a complete site.

You can use it to build a dynamic site, to make up for the fact that vercel can only create static sites.

VCLight is based on plugins. You can write plugins and apply them, or use third-party modules.

**Prerequisites:**

The rest of the documentation assumes basic familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you are totally new to frontend development, it might not be the best idea to jump right into a framework as your first step - grasp the basics and then come back! You can check your knowledge level with [this JavaScript overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript). Prior experience with other frameworks helps, but is not required.
